# Design-and-Verification-of-FIFO
A FIFO stands for First-In, First-Out. It operates on the principle that the first data to enter the structure is the first to be removed. In other words, it follows the rule of "first come, first served". We have used two pointers -read pointer and write pointer to point current address of read and write operations. Created a verification environment to verify the FIFO module. The stimulus are generated with 50% probability for read and write operations. Generator class generates the stimulus by randomizing the transaction class and sends it to driver class. Driver sends the data to DUT via interface. The DUT then sends the data to monitor via interface which then sends it to scoreboard which compares the received data from monitor with the received data from generator. The data is transmitted between classes using mailbox. There are two mailboxes- Generator + Driver mailbox and Monitor + Scoreboard mailbox.
